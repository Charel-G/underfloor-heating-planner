# Underfloor Heating Planner

This project contains a small HTML5 application for planning underfloor heating layouts. It now supports multiple floors, drawing walls that snap to 45Â° angles, rectangular distributors and basic heating zones. The application can generate a simple snake-like pipe layout.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the toolbar to add floors and select which floor to view. Draw walls or zones and place distributors. Grid size and pipe spacing can be adjusted. Click **Draw Pipes** to create a minimal pipe layout. **Clear** removes all items from the current floor.
