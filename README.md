# Underfloor Heating Planner

This project contains a small HTML5 application for planning underfloor heating layouts. It now allows you to draw rectangular rooms on a canvas, place distributors and generate a very simple pipe layout using a snake pattern.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the toolbar buttons to draw rooms or add distributor positions. You can change the grid size and pipe spacing before drawing. Click **Draw Pipes** to generate a basic layout. The **Clear** button resets the canvas.
