# Underfloor Heating Planner

This project contains a small HTML5 application for planning underfloor heating layouts. It supports multiple floors, walls with angle and point snapping, draggable lines with editable lengths, rectangular distributors and zones assigned to distributors. The application can generate a simple snake-like pipe layout from each distributor to its zones.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the toolbar to add floors and select which floor to view. The **Draw Wall** tool creates snapping lines. Use **Select/Move** to drag whole lines or their ends and edit their length in the **Line Length** input. Zones are drawn with **Draw Zone** and connected to a distributor when created. Adjust grid size and default pipe spacing as needed. Click **Draw Pipes** to generate a minimal layout. **Clear** removes all items from the current floor.
