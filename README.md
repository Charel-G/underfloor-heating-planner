# Underfloor Heating Planner

This project contains a minimal HTML5 application for planning underfloor heating layouts. It provides a canvas element where a floor plan grid is drawn. Further functionality can be added to allow drawing rooms, placing distributors, and automatically laying pipes.

To use the tool, open `index.html` in a web browser.
